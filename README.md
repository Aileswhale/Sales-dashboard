# Excel Sales Analysis Dashboard Project

## Project Overview
This project is a Sales Analysis Dashboard built in Microsoft Excel, designed to provide dynamic, data-driven insights into sales performance across multiple dimensions. It visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) such as monthly revenue trends, category-wise sales breakdown, regional revenue comparison, and plan achievement rate, using interactive charts and pivot tables.
The dashboard is powered by data transformations and summary statistics derived from pivot tables in the backend, specifically from the “Pivot Table” sheet. The visuals are designed to help decision-makers quickly identify top-performing regions, product categories, and time periods, while also tracking performance against planned targets.
